# Spiffy Active Commerce Surface

Produce a snapshot of the merchant's current commerce surface. Combines products and checkouts because neither alone tells the full story.

## Why this skill exists

A Spiffy product can be `is_active: true` with no purchasable checkout (grandfathered subscription delivery) and a checkout can exist without a product wrapper (v1 legacy pattern). Listing only products or only checkouts is misleading. This skill combines both views and flags the gap.

Important. `status: "active"` on a checkout means "exists in admin", not "publicly purchasable". A team member may have removed the sales-page link while leaving the API status as active. To confirm "publicly sold", cross-reference active checkouts against the merchant's main-website sales pages.

## Inputs

- No required inputs. Defaults to the full account inventory.

## Data sources

1. `products_list` with pagination, accumulate all products until `meta.pagination.has_more` is false. (Pagination metadata lives under `meta.pagination`, NOT at the top level.)

2. `product_get` per product (provides nested `options[].prices[].amount` in cents and the `checkouts[]` array of attached checkouts).

3. `checkout_list` with pagination, accumulate all checkouts until accumulated length is at least the `count` field.

4. Cross-reference.

   - Products whose `checkouts[]` array contains at least one entry with status `active` in the v1 list, classify as "live products".

   - Products with `is_active: true` but zero active checkouts, classify as "orphan products" (typically grandfathered).

   - Checkouts with status `active` whose `id` does not appear in any product's `checkouts[]` array, classify as "orphan checkouts" (v1 legacy pattern).

## Output format

```markdown
# Spiffy Active Commerce Surface - {YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC}

**Account** {account name}. **Products total** {N}. **Checkouts total** {N}.

## Live products ({M})

Products with at least one active checkout. Candidates for "currently sold". Verify against the merchant's website before publishing externally.

| Product | Product ID | Price | Frequency | Active checkouts |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| {name} | {pid} | ${X.XX} | {month / year / one-time} | {cid_1, cid_2} |

## Orphan products ({M})

Products with `is_active: true` and zero active checkouts. Typically grandfathered subscription products still delivering to existing customers but closed to new sales.

| Product | Product ID | Last checkout status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| {name} | {pid} | {expired or deleted} | {if relevant} |

## Orphan checkouts ({M})

Active checkouts not wrapped by any product. v1 legacy pattern. Price is configured on the checkout itself.

| Checkout | Checkout ID | URL slug | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| {name} | {cid} | /{slug} | active |

## Caveats

- "Live products" reflects API-purchasable state. To confirm "publicly sold", cross-reference `{merchant subdomain}.spiffy.co/checkout/{slug}` against the merchant's main-website sales pages.

- Prices shown read from `options[0].prices[0].amount`. Multi-option products may have additional tiers; use `product_get` for full detail.

- Currency assumed single-account-wide (typically USD). Multi-currency accounts will need adaptation.
```

## Failure modes

- If `products_list` pagination would exceed ~20 pages (1000+ products), warn the user and offer to scope by a filter such as recently created.

- If `checkout_list` pagination would exceed ~20 pages, same.

- If `product_get` returns 404 for a product surfaced in `products_list` (race during deletion), skip and add a note to Caveats.

- If the account has zero active products and zero active checkouts, produce the report with zeros and "No active commerce surface found." in the summary.
